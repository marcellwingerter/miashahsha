Here (https://imgur.com/gallery/pDa2VYs) is a visual representation of what instruments we prefer- all organized by band leader. I should add that only 10 of those 30 keyboard albums are rhythm section records, the other 20 have horns.

I'm a long time collector so these were all stored correctly and treated well over the years. Not a lot of time for listening these days so thinning out the herd. Bowie - Live in Santa Monica - UK pressing from 2008, first legit issue of this oft bootlegged show. Mine is #2978/5000. Played once and still in shrink wrap. Comes with really cool poster.

It's been a long time since I tried this. This time I'm bringing you some awesome deals on killer music. And, since I'm a 45 lover/hoarder and hardly ever see posts like this - time to run a sale. There are over 300 45s priced at  on this list. There are a lot of Singles priced well below their market values, and a lot of great NM stock copies of essential jams. I have even better mid-range to high end stuff on my Discogs store which I will also discount. A lot of us are new to drinking. Here are some safety tips: - edit, /r/thegadiantonwitches Uber might be doing free rides tonight! Check and confirm this! Please be safe! One death is too many! One accident is too many! Check the Uber and Lyft apps! Call a friend! - DO NOT DRINK AND DRIVE. Taxi/Uber/Designated Driver. Yes, you pay a little cash for transportation. But it's much more affordable than the cost of car repairs, a lawsuit, a criminal attorney, jail time, your job, your relationshi. Hi /r/guitar, UPDATE: Here's the next 200 ( I teach guitar lessons for a living. Part of my job is curating songs that my students might like to play. While some students know exactly what they want to learn and enthusiastically pursue every item on their ever-growing "to-learn" list, others just want to know what songs they're supposed to learn. Unfortunately, no such songs exist, and I alway. So I'm a huge fan of drum n bass music and I was scouring the internet for mixes to listen to when I found something that I think many people here would be very interested in. There's a series by Mixmag magazine called "Alter Ego" where famous DJs throw down sets from genres that they're not normally known for. Some DJs kept things fairly similar to their wheelhouse but one really set the bar high for the series. High Contrast is one of the most famous and lauded members This album by Booker t and the MGs: green onions. And if you do or have already, do you think the instruments on "mo onions" are out of time with each other? Jamming out right now it's fantastic instrumental blues Cheers. I love country music, and there's a lot of great country songs out there that people have used for their father/daughter dances. But I never wanted one of them for my wedding. I am now a little more than a month out and I still haven't decided what song to use. My favorite song of all time is Vienna by Billy Joel (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZdiXvDU4P0). I remember where I was when I first heard it and for years I have always come back to it and it makes me learn something new about. I apologize for the length of this post in advance! I am the Public Address Announcer for the Grand Junction Rockies (Rookie A level for the Colorado Rockies), and I am searching for some new songs to play during games either between innings, or for certain situations. Any and all Between Innings songs, Batting songs, joke batting songs, joke songs, et cetera songs that one would enjoy hearing at a minor league baseball game would be incredibly appreciated!

The video was recently deleted off Youtube because it violated copyright. It had 2million+ views and was a music video composed of clips of beautiful women dancing from various movie scenes. The song was Green Onions by Booker T & the MG's. One of the clips is of a red-headed actress dancing in a jazz style through a room of people, and I'm dying to find the video that clip was sourced from. Just knowing the actress's name or the movie the clip is from would be helpful Big list of 7”s for sale! Shipping is  flat for as much as you want. I prefer paypal as a gift, but will do standard paypal if you are willing to pay the fees. ---7”S---  – The Adverts – One Chord Wonder (nm-) – vinyl is pristine, Stiff records sleeve is very nice. Classic Uk punk.  - Archaic – Noise in Your Head (nm-) – INCREDIBLE Spanish punk. Nearly a perfect record.  – Back to Back – Flesh and Bone (nm-, Lockin Out) – Texas hardcore.  – Bob Dylane – Like a Rolling Stone. Trying not to make this a generic favorite song thread. I'm looking for some music that's refreshing, and not bland pop or rock. Couple examples off the top my head are Jungle - Busy Earnin' (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcsfftwLUf0) Booker T and the MG's - Green Onions (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bpS-cOBK6Q) This should be a cool discussion.
